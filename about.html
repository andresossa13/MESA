  <!-- ABOUT US SECTION -->
  <main class="hero">
    <h4>Welcome to Indiepalooza, the newest and most exciting indie gaming festival on the block! Our festival is a
      celebration of independent game developers from all around the world, showcasing their innovative and unique
      creations to a global audience.</h4>
    <p>At Indiepalooza, we believe that independent games are the future of the gaming industry. They bring fresh ideas
      and perspectives, pushing the boundaries of what we think of as traditional games. Our festival is a platform for
      these developers to showcase their work, network with fellow creators, and connect with gamers who are hungry for
      something new and exciting.</p>
    <p>Our festival features a variety of games across all genres, including action, adventure, puzzle, simulation, and
      more. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just looking for something new and exciting, there's something for
      everyone at Indiepalooza.</p>
    <p>In addition to showcasing indie games, Indiepalooza is also a space for discussion and learning. We host
      workshops and panels featuring game developers, designers, and industry experts who share their knowledge and
      insights with our audience. These sessions cover a wide range of topics, including game development, marketing,
      distribution, and more.</p>
    <p>At Indiepalooza, we believe that gaming is for everyone. That's why our festival is designed to be inclusive and
      welcoming to all. We strive to create a safe and inclusive space where people from all backgrounds can come
      together to celebrate the creativity and innovation of independent game development.</p>
    <p>We're excited to bring Indiepalooza to life and share it with the world. Join us for a weekend of gaming,
      learning, and fun as we celebrate the vibrant and diverse world of indie gaming.</p>
